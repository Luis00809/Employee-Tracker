   # Employee Tracker

   ## Description
   
   This application allows a user to keep track of employess, departments, and roles that are in a business. This app allows for easy navigation and editing of a database. While creating this project I learned that you can chain a query() to a promise() so that a sending a query to a database now becomes asynchronous.

   ## Usage
   
  A user can use this application by running noce index.js and then the user will be presented with prompts. There, the user can choose to look at data that is stored in the database or to create new roles, departments, or add an employee. 
   
  

Here is what the application should display when the user runs node index.js:

   ## Credits
   
    I want to give credit to my bootcamp TA Juno Nguyen for helping me turn my queries into asych functions. I would also want to credit phind for helping me generate queries for updating an employee, specifically when grabbing ids from another table.

   ## How to Contribute
   The code in the index.js file can be rafactored to look cleaner. The code does work but the prompts can be turned into functions as there are several of them on the main function.
